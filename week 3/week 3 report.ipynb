    "Car accidents are one of the most common issues found across the globe to be severe.Accidents might sometimes be due to our negligence or due to natural reasons or anything.Sometimes, we might be too lazy or negligent to drive costing our lives as well as the others.Whereas sometimes, due to heavy rain or heavy gales etc. we might unknowingly droop into an accident with the other car.Whatever the reason maybe, car accidents not only lead to property damage but cause injuries and sometimes even leading to people's death.In our project we decide how these accidents occur due to weather conditions.So, the main problem or question arising in this depressing situation is\n",

    "# Discussion¶\n",
    "Our main aim was to predict the severity of the accident when it is “serious” and “fatal”. It was very difficult to handle this large-sized data. Using HPC we were able to run most of our algorithms. Data is highly imbalanced so even though most of our algorithms were giving > 89% accuracies, it was of no use. It was predicting all the accidents as slight accidents. After checking on all these algorithms, the team even tried dimensionality reduction techniques and but the results were not improved. Then the team decided to use the undersampled dataset as it was giving better results in predicting the severe/fatal accidents. This decision was made on trying out oversampling, undersampling, test and train data with an equal ratio of classification classes.\n",

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "In conclusion, most of the algorithms are biased towards most frequent class. However, efficient pre-processing and corresponding imbalanced data techniques should give optimal results. Based on the current known conditions of weather, light, traffic signal, road surface, speed limit etc., accident severity can be classified. But there is no one feature, that influences the accident severity."
